# PlayPalz
PlayPalz are wrist-worn devices designed to enhance interactions amongst children at the playground. As part of the 3.007 course at SUTD, the double diamond process was adopted, where problem discovery and scoping was done before diving into the solution space. Playpalz tackles the human tendency to stay away from people who we consider different from ourselves by utilizing technology and a suite of features that center around collaborative mini-games/quests that randomly connect children in the same playground.
